# zstd-py

This aim of this project is to produce a _pure-Python_ implementation of the Zstandard compression algorithm for educational purposes. It's not trying to be as efficient as possible; there are plenty of other performance-oriented implementations. Instead, I just want to learn how Zstandard works and, ideally, help others learn as well.

I'm basically just walking through [RFC8878](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8878), implementing each section in turn.
